Sets up the database in 2 scripts. 
I have changed 3 things 
some of the primary keys have been revised to reflect the new data in the relation they form
SOme of the names have been changed to reflect a single style of naming attributes
and 1 of the foregin keys has changed to reflect the better use of arttribute naming.

run creates db V7 first 
then run inserts non generic 

These two scripts work perfectly. tested on  mulitple machines 
Stuart and i worked on ht edatabase connection today it offically works we checked both on visual studio side and mysql verifies it.
GREAT WORK!

can everyone else please show what they have we are having another meeting on Thursday during our tutorial.
Thanks 
Ryan
